# CLAUDE.MD -- Applied Econometrics Research with Claude Code

<!-- HOW TO USE: Replace [BRACKETED PLACEHOLDERS] with your project info.
     Customize Beamer environments for your talk preamble.
     Keep this file under ~150 lines — Claude loads it every session.
     See the guide at https://hsantanna88.github.io/clo-author/ for full documentation. -->

**Project:** The COVID-19 Shock to Primary Education: Cross-Cohort Evidence from Ukraine's State Monitoring Programme
**Institution:** Central European University, Vienna, Austria
**Branch:** master

## Core Principles

- **Plan first** -- enter plan mode before non-trivial tasks; save plans to `quality_reports/plans/`
- **Verify after** -- compile and confirm output at the end of every task
- **Single source of truth** -- Paper `main.tex` is authoritative; talks and supplements derive from it
- **Quality gates** -- weighted aggregate score; nothing ships below 80/100; see `scoring-protocol.md`
- **Worker-critic pairs** -- every creator has a paired critic; critics never edit files
- **[LEARN] tags** -- when corrected, save `[LEARN:category] wrong → right` to MEMORY.md
